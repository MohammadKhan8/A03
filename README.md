Glossary
* Branch: A branch is a copy of a codeline, managed in a version control system (VCS). Branching helps software development teams work in parallel. It separates out “in-progress work” from tested and stable code. The codebase in a VCS is often referred to as the trunk, baseline, master, or mainline.
* Clone: In a software system, similar or identical fragments of code are known as code clones.
* Commit: In version control systems, a commit is an operation which sends the latest changes of the source code to the repository, making these changes part of the head revision of the repository.
* Fetch: Fetch is the retrieval of data by a software program, script, or hardware device.
* GIT: Git (/ɡɪt/) is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
* Github: GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control
* Merge: Merging code allows multiple software developers to integrate changes into their codebase. 
* Merge Conflict: A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
* Push: to place a data item onto a stack.
* Pull: Pull means to request data from another program or computer.
* Remote: Remote access refers to the technology that allows users to access a device or a network from an offsite location
* Repository: A software repository, or “repo” for short, is a storage location for software packages. Often a table of contents is also stored, along with metadata
